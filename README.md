Hello this is an app I build as a group while at Flatiron school. We worked as a team of three (Cheng, Lex and Me)

This app is a portal for teachers and students.

It allows teachers to take in students and assign them homework or change their grade.

The students are able to complete assignments and give their teacher feedback
